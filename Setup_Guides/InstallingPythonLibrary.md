## Setting up Peter Todd's Bitcoin Library

1. First thing to do is download the folder from Peter Todds Github Page https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/archive/master.zip
2. After installing the zip file you will need to go to file manager which is on the top left hand side 
3. Once in file manager click on Downloads that is where you have installed the zipped folder
4. Now that your in the Downloads folder scroll down and find python-bitcoinlib-master.zip 
5. Once you have found it right click on it and click extract here or go to the terminal and run this command unzip Downloads/python-bitcoinlib-master
6. Whatever way you did it you should have an unzipped file called python-bitcoinlib-master in the Downloads folder
7. Now that your in the terminal you need to navigate to the python-bitcoinlib-master folder
8. So type cd Downloads and press enter (cd stands for Change Directory) now once your in the Downloads folder enter ls (ls stands for list segments it lists all the segments in the current directory)
9. So the next thing to do is cd python-bitcoinlib-master now run ls and you will see a file called setup.py so type sudo setup.py install
10. Now you will see it installing it wont take long maybe 10-15 seconds maybe less when its finished
11. You can either type python after it has finished typing python will bring you to the python command line or the other thing to do is click on menu in the top left hand side and then to programming, you dont have to click on this if you dont want to just wave your mouse over it and click python 2
12. The last thing to do is once you have either ran python in the terminal or gone to python's interface you can type import bitcoin if you get no errors you have installed it correctly
